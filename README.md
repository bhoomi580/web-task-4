# 📱 Responsive Hero Section + To-Do List

## 📖 Overview

- A **Hero section** with navigation and a call-to-action button.
- A **To-Do List app** for adding, marking, and deleting tasks.
- Fully responsive design following standard mobile-first steps.

## 📊 Responsiveness Implementation (Checklist)
1. **Open the HTML page in VS Code** – HTML, CSS, and JS files are well-structured and linked.
2. **Identify fixed-width elements / large images** – No fixed-width images; flexible containers and percentages are used.
3. **Media queries for `max-width: 768px`** – Implemented in `style.css` to handle layout changes for smaller screens.
4. **Adjust layout for small screens** – Navbar stacks vertically, hero text scales down.
5. **Navigation menu collapses** – Hamburger menu (`.hamburger`) appears under 768px width.
6. **Tested with Chrome DevTools** – Layout adapts correctly to mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
7. **Fix overflow and scrolling issues** – No horizontal scroll detected; content fits within screen.
8. **Images scale within containers** – No fixed-size images; icons from Font Awesome scale responsively.
